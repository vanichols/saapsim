The actual EXTRACTION and RAW files are not stored here because they are too big. 

The code in this folder is just for reference - it will not run without the contents of those folders. 

To create the data contained in those folders, use the XX_code-get-ssurgo-data-do-not-run.

Currently all of the 'run' code is stored in Gina_APSIM_modelling in Box.
