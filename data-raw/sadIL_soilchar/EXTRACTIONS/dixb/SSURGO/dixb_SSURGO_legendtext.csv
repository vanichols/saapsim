05/23/2002 00:00:00,Correlation notes,acid/non-acid,alluvial soils,The published soil survey recognized both acid and non-acid alluvial soils.  In some areas where field studies and soil data are available acid to non-acid and non-acid to acid correlations were made.  This resulted in multiple acid/non-acid correlations of some of the alluvial soils.,15372,67787
05/23/2002 00:00:00,Correlation notes,fragipan/nonfragipan,slope break,The published soil survey recognized fragipan soils on slopes greater than 18 percent.  A correlation decision was made based field studies and soil laboratory data to correlate fragipan soils on slopes steeper than 18 percent to soils without fragipans.  This often resulted in multiple correlations based on landform and soil type.,15372,67788

05/28/2002 00:00:00,Correlation notes,soil temperature,mesic/thermic,"Temperature studies indicate, in general, the soils on the uplands are mesic and the soils on the Mississippi River bottomlands are thermic; thus both regimes were used in the survey area.  (Union County Correlation - August 1977.)  Two follow-up soil temperature studies (1997-2001) have been conducted during this update.",15372,67794
05/22/2002 00:00:00,Correlation notes,slope conversion,upland soils,"Slopes were adjusted to fit the Southern 7 Legend.  Slope classes of mapunits on the published legend differ from slope classes in this legend in the following ways: 

   PUBLISHED	        UPDATE
SLOPE 	PERCENT	    SLOPE    PERCENT
A	0-2	      A	        0-2
B	2-4	      B	        2-5
C	4-7	      C	        5-10
D	7-12	      D		10-18
E	12-18	      E		18-25
F	18-30	      F		25-35 
G	30-60	      F		18-35
		      G		35-70
 
When delineations on the published maps conform to the old standard slope ranges, conversions generally are as follows: 

     MAJOR           MINOR 
  A goes to A 
  B goes to B 
  C goes to C       C to B 
  D goes to C 
  D goes to D 
  E goes to D 
  F goes to E       F to F 
  G goes to G       G to F

Where published and update slope classes overlap, slope maps and field investigations have been used to determine line placement and mapunit slope designation. 
  
Multiple correlations exist because of slope adjustment, better slope definition, slope overlap of adjacent mapping units and because we are using a larger mapscale.",15372,67795
05/23/2002 00:00:00,Correlation notes,name conventions,alluvial soils,"Published map units on slopes of 0 to 2 percent did not have a slope letter in the map symbol and the slope range was not in the mapunit name.  Also, alluvial soils did not have flooding frequency or duration in the mapunit name.  

With this update, all mapunits, except miscellaneous units, have a slope letter in the mapunit symbol and the slope range stated in the mapunit name.  In addition, alluvial soils have flooding frequency stated in the mapunit name and the flooding prefix is part of the mapunit symbol.  Brief duration is assumed.  If duration is other than brief, it is added as part of the mapunit name and a letter is added as a suffix to the mapunit symbol.

Prefix	Description	                Suffix	Description
1	undrained, frequently flooded	   L	Long duration
3	Frequently flooded		
5	karst		
7	Rarely flooded

02/18/2003 00:00:00,Correlation notes,series,typical pedon,"Pope County Correlation Notes by Soil Series

ALFORD: The typical pedon is from Hardin County, Illinois. 

ALVIN: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois.

ARMIESBURG: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois.  The typical pedon is described with low chroma clay films in the solum.  The depth to the base of the argillic is more than 60 inches.  Armiesburg needs to be field checked in the future to determine if these conditions still exist and if they are typical for the Southern 7 counties.

BAXTER: The typical pedon is from Union County, Illinois.

BEASLEY: The typical pedon is from Pope County, Illinois.  Beasley soils are typically correlated over Ordivician aged, calcareous (marl) shales in MLRA 121. In Massac and Pope Counties, the Beasley soils are correlated over Mississippian aged limestone, shale and sandstone. The published soil survey describes Beasley soils as moderately well drained with a water table above the bedrock.  The typical pedon also describes the depth to a possible paralithic contact at 36 inches.  These soils should be evaluated in the future to determine drainage class and to compare how the Beasley soils are correlated in MLRA 121 with the Beasely soil correlated in the Southern 7.

BEAUCOUP: The typical pedon is from Monroe County, Illinois.  

BEDFORD: The typical pedon is from Hardin County, Illinois.  

BELKNAP: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois

RACOON: The typical pedon is from Saline County, Illinois (OSD type location). 

ROBBS: The typical pedon is from Johnson County, Illinois.    

SAFFELL: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois. The Saffell soils are taxadjuncts to the series.  Saffell is classified  as Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludults. The typifying pedon is probably a Paleudult.  The thickness of the solum is outside the range allowed by the OSD.  Saffell was classified as a Typic Hapludults in the published soil survey.  There was no time to conduct field investigations for this update.  We left the classification as is for now.  These soils need to be evaluated sometime in the future to determine if they classify as Paleudults or Hapludults.
