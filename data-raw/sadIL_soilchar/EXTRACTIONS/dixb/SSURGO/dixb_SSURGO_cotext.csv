This component is on flood plains on valleys. The parent material consists of silty alluvium. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is moderately well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very high.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 48 inches during January, February, March, April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   ",17497729,17447746
