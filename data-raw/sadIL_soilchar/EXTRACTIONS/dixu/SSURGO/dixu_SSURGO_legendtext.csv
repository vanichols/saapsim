05/22/2002 00:00:00,Correlation notes,slope conversion,upland soils,"Slopes were adjusted to fit the Southern 7 Legend.  Slope classes of mapunits on the published legend differ from slope classes in this legend in the following ways: 

   PUBLISHED	       UPDATE
SLOPE 	PERCENT	  SLOPE  PERCENT
A	 0-1.5	    A	  0-2
B      1.5-4	    B	  2-5
C	4-7	    C	  5-10
D	7-12	    D	 10-18
E	12-18	    E	 18-25
F	18-30	    F	 25-35 
G	 >30	    F	 18-35
		    G	 35-70
 

When delineations on the published maps conform to the old standard slope ranges, conversions generally are as follows: 

     MAJOR           MINOR 
  A goes to A 
  B goes to B 
  C goes to C       C to B 
  D goes to C       
  D goes to D 
  E goes to D 
  F goes to E       F to F 
  G goes to G       G to F

Where published and update slope classes overlap, slope maps and field investigations have been used to determine line placement and mapunit slope designation. 
  
Multiple correlations exist because of slope adjustment, better slope definition, slope overlap of adjacent mapping units and because we are using a larger mapscale.",11349,67736

*Banlic:The typical pedon is from Perry County, Illinois. (OSD type location).  Banlic is a taxadjunct to the series because the colors are not gray enough to meet the Aquepts criteria. The soil classifies as a Fragiaquic Dystrudepts.  

BELKNAP: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois. 
 
BERKS: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois. 
   
BONNIE: The typical pedon is from Alexander County, Illinois.  
 
BURNSIDE: The typical pedon is from Johnson County, Illinois.  It is the OSD type location for Burnside.  SERIES ESTABLISHED: Johnson County, Illinois, 1954.  
 
CAPE: The typical pedon is from Saline County, Illinois (OSD type location).  

DARWIN: The typical pedon is from Union County, Illinois.  
 
DUPO: The typical pedon is from Randolph County, Illinois (OSD type location).  SCS analyzed at the University of Illinois Soils Lab data from sample S72IL-91-15 (1-8) sampled as Unnamed and correlated to Dupo. 

GINAT: The typical pedon is from Pope County, Illinois.  Limited field investigations for this update.  The OSD for Ginat has been reclassified from a Fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Fragiaqualfs to a Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Endoaqualfs.  The pedons described and observed in this update indicate that fragic properties exist in many pedons. These soils should be evaluated in the future to determine if fragic properties are predominate. 
  
GRANTSBURG: The typical pedon is from Pope County, Illinois (OSD type location). 
 
HATFIELD: Weinbach correlated to Hatfield.  The typical pedon is the former Weinbach site in Massac County.  The pedon described has a solum that is thinner than allowed for Hatfield.  The C1 horizon in the description may actually be a BC or a B horizon. A field investigation will be needed sometime in the future to resolve this.
 
HOSMER: The typical pedon is from Union County, Illinois.  These areas were correlated in the 1978 published soil survey report of Union County.  Soil Survey Investigation Unit, Lincoln, NE samples S73IL-91-35(73LI020-22), S73IL-91-36(73LI023-25)  were sampled and correlated as Hosmer.  Sample S73IL-91-37(73LI026-28) was sampled as Muren and correlated as Hosmer.  University of Illinois Department of Transportation Engineering Test data from sample 75IL091-5-(1-2) sampled and correlated as Hosmer. 

KARNAK: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois (OSD type location). 

LAMONT: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois.  The pedon described has a solum that is thinner than allowed for Lamont.  The typical pedon has no lamella described.  Field investigations will be needed in the future to determine if these differences are typical. 

MENFRO: The typical pedon is from St. Clair County, Illinois.   

MUSKINGUM: The typical pedon is from Pope County, Illinois.

PETROLIA: The typical pedon is from Pulaski County, Illinois.  

PIOPOLIS: The typical pedon is from Hamilton County, Illinois (OSD type location). 
  
ROBBS: The typical pedon is from Johnson County, Illinois. 

SCIOTOVILLE: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois. The Sciotoville soils are taxadjuncts to the series.  They have fragic soil properties, not a well developed fragipan like the established series.  They classify as Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Fragiaquic Hapludalfs. 

SHARON: The typical pedon is from Williamson County, Illinois (OSD type location). 

STOY: The typical pedon is from Gallatin County, Illinois.  Stoy soils have fragic properties.

WEIKERT: This DMU was developed based on pedon 98IL087002E (CCA #81).
 
WELLSTON: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois.  

WESTMORE: The typical pedon is from Union County, Illinois.

WHEELING: The typical pedon is from Massac County, Illinois.

Also, alluvial soils did not have flooding frequency or duration in the mapunit name.  

With this update, all mapunits, except miscellaneous units, have a slope letter in the mapunit symbol and the slope range stated in the mapunit name.  In addition, alluvial soils have flooding frequency stated in the mapunit name and the flooding prefix is part of the mapunit symbol.  Brief duration is assumed.  If duration is other than brief, it is added as part of the mapunit name and a letter is added as a suffix to the mapunit symbol.

05/23/2002 00:00:00,Correlation notes,fragipan/nonfragipan,slope break,The published soil survey recognized fragipan soils on slopes greater than 18 percent.  A correlation decision was made based field studies and soil laboratory data to correlate fragipan soils on slopes steeper than 18 percent to soils without fragipans.  This often resulted in multiple correlations based on landform and soil type.,11349,67745
