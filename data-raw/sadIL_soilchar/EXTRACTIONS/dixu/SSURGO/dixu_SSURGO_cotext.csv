The parent material consists of Peoria loess /roxana loess/residuum. Depth to a root restrictive layer, fragipan, is 24 to 40 inches. The natural drainage class is moderately well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 30 inches during January, February, March, April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2e.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.",17489279,17439296
