08/29/2016 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,"The Muscatune component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. This component is on ground moraines, till plains. The parent material consists of Peoria loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 18 inches during January, February, March, April, May. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 5 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 1.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ",17501925,17451942
