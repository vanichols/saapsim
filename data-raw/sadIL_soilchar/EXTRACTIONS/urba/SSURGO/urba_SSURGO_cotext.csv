This component is on outwash plains on plains. The parent material consists of loess over stratified loamy outwash. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is frequently ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 6 inches during January, February, March, April, May. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 6 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.   ",17482205,17432222
