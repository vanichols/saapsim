02/13/2014 00:00:00,Correlation notes,evaluation,attribute,"The ""Drummer silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes"" map units in MLRA 108A are part of the Soil Data Join Re-Correlation (SDJR) Initiative.  The map unit concepts will be identified from the soil survey manuscripts and the map units consolidated so that data population is consistent wherever they are mapped. 

Drummer is classified as: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls. The Drummer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and the underlying loamy stratified outwash on nearly level or depressional parts of outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches). Drummer is the state soil and also a benchmark soil. 

Drummer is of large extent-correlated in MLRAs 95B, 97, 108A, 108B, 110, 111C, 111D, 113, 114A, 114B, 115A, 115C, and 121. Some of the Drummer soils mapped have gravelly substratum or stratified sandy substratum phases and will not be included in this SDJR project. These phases are found in Benton and Warren Counties, in MLRAs 110, 111C, 111D, and a little bit in 108A. These substratum phases will be investigated separately in a field project. The following Drummer mapunits will also be investigated in a separate Drummer SDJR project and given a different map unit name: 1) the Drummer soils that occur in MLRAs 114A, 114B, and 121, and 2) the map units that occur in MLRA 115A in Southern Indiana (Knox, Daviess, Pike, Gibson, Warrick, Posey, and Spencer Counties) should be investigated with 114A, 114B, and 121. The Drummer map unit from Edgar County (MLRA 115A occurs in a small extent in Edgar County) is included in this project. More than 500,000 acres have been correlated in Illinois alone but total acreage is just less than 1,500,000 acres. The type location is in Champaign County, Illinois, in MLRA 108A. 


During the initial evaluation and assessment it was identified there were 37 ""Drummer silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, map units; 2 Drummer silty clay loam, map units; 1 Drummer silt loam, map unit; and 1 Drummer silty clay loams, undifferentiated group. The ""Drummer silty clay loams, undifferentiated groups"" was removed from the project because it required field work. 12 data map units (DMUs) were also identified: 123484, 151641, 142718, 408103, 142587, 140762, 453966, 122049, 142579, 140859, 140567, and 137219. However, 2 DMUs were removed: 142579 (because it was an undrained Drummer and the water table is different) and 122049 (because it was an undifferentiated group in Warren County, IN, and requires a special project). 

For now, the map units in Illinois and Benton County, Indiana, will be reviewed as one physiographic area, and that project is assigned to the 11-AUR, Aurora, Illinois office for re-correlation. The consolidation project will reduce the number of map units to one MLRA map unit and will reduce the numbers of data map units to one data map unit. The new DMU will be created using available data from existing data map units, NASIS pedons, and KSSL, and university lab data. The map units will meet national standards. The official series descriptions will be reviewed and updated during this process, as will all of the KSSL samples. Relevant pedons, primarily TUDs, will be entered into NASIS, and a representative component pedon will be selected.
