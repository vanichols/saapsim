08/23/2013 00:00:00,Correlation notes,evaluation,,"The Flanagan silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes map units in MLRA 108A are parts of the Soil Data Join Re-correlation (SDJR) Initiative. This initiative will focus on the reconciling of map units with the same or similar names and on correlation of soil properties and interpretations across the MLRA. Map unit symbols and names will stay the same. The multiple map units and data map units will be consolidated to one national map unit symbol and one data map unit symbol. The new Flanagan data map unit will be modified using available data from existing data map units, NASIS pedons, and University of Illinois lab data. The map units will meet national and MO-11 standards. The Official Series Description will be updated as part of the process. 

This project will be looking at 154A - Flanagan silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes (21 map units) in Illinois and FgA - Flanagan silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, in Vermillion County, Indiana. This new data map unit ID (DMUID) 675979 is being created for the Soil Data Join Recorrelation (SDJR) Initiative for the 154A and FgA map units. The new data map unit is created from a copy of the old DMUIID. The new data map unit will be modified using all available data from review of existing data map units, NASIS pedons, and University of Illinois laboratory data. 

Minor components were determined by evaluating what was listed as minor components in the published soil surveys along with what was populated in NASIS. The list was evaluated and the most common minor components were selected. All components were reviewed and edited. They passed all validations and requirements of National Bulletin 430-5-7. 

Flanagan soils are of large extent being correlated in MLRAs 95B, 108A, and 110 with small acreages extending into MLRAs 108B and 115C. They are mapped in central and north-central Illinois and in west-central Indiana. Within MLRA 108A there are 618,447 acres mapped Flanagan. The acreage can be revised once the project is approved by the management team and the map units are loaded into the project. The type location is in Champaign County, Illinois, in MLRA 108A.

The evaluation and assessment began with the querying of the Flanagan data map units (DMUs) and map units in NASIS. There are 21 map units and 5 DMUs for MLRA 108A. I also created a Flanagan distribution map using ArcMap to identify the survey areas and MLRAs in which Flanagan occurs. Upon further investigation inconsistencies between the geologic members and the parent materials were discovered. The Lemont Formation consists of three members: the Haeger Member as the uppermost unit, the Yorkville Member as the middle diamicton, and the Batestown Member as the lower boundary. The Yorkville Till Member extends well into the LaSalle County, Illinois, soil survey area.  The LaSalle County soil survey area is one area in which Flanagan is mapped. The Yorkville Member consists of calcareous, gray; fine textured (silty clay to silty clay loam) diamicton that contains lenses of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. However, the Flanagan soils consist of loess over loam till. In some areas-LaSalle County, in particular-Flanagan is mapped near silty clay loam till soils. Loam till is not commonly found in the Yorkville Member. Future projects involving transects need to be done on the Flanagan soils and nearby silty clay loam till soils within MLRA 108A to ascertain the type of till. The Flanagan soils occurring on the Yorkville Till Member may need to be re-correlated to a more appropriate soil. 

Within MLRA 108A, Flanagan silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes will be re-correlated to a single map unit concept and to a single NASIS map unit record. The data map unit (DMU) will be fully populated with the required data element. The TUDs from the original soil survey reports will be located, updated, and entered into NASIS (if need be). The TUD locations will also be located on screen to make sure they fall into the Flanagan units. Additionally, the Flanagan pedons that were previously sampled will be classified to the latest version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy and linked to the Flanagan DMU record.
