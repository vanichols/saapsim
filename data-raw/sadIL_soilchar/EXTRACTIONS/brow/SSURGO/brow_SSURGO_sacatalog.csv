The tabular database was edited and populated according to guidance in Exhibits A and B of National Instruction (NI-305), and Part 610 of the National Soil Survey Handbook. Any spatial data edits were certified correct by the Soil Survey region, State Soil Scientist (SSS), and by the National Digitizing Center. The SSS certified the data population for all map units, and concurred with correlation of all projects mentioned, as they were documented in Soil Survey Area Legend(s) and in the Project Correlation table.

The SSS certified the data population for all map units, and concurred with correlation of all projects mentioned, as they were documented in Soil Survey Area Legend(s) and in the Project Correlation table.

This dataset also contains the following changes:

A. All spatial data was processed and refreshed to reduce geometry size and coordinate precision of SSURGO, and to standardize the vertice density of our surveys. It is estimated that this reduced the geometry size of SSURGO to around 10 GB. This is an over 50% reduction in size, and will therefore greatly optimize our data for future usage and efficiency in publishing and interacting with it, at all levels. 

B. The five national interpretations listed below are new and revised:
1. FOR - Windthrow Hazard (New for FY20)
2. FOR - Mechanical Planting Suitability
3. FOR - Mechanical Site Preparation (Deep)
4. FOR - Mechanical Site Preparation (Surface)
5. FOR - Potential Erosion Hazard (Off-Road/Off-Trail)

C. Recalculated all national and local interpretations for all components.

This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
</abstract><purpose>
SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.
</purpose><supplinf>
Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products
derived from these data.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than that at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

This soil survey contains information that can be applied in
managing farms and wetlands; in selecting sites for roads, ponds,
buildings, and other structures; and in judging the suitability
of tracts of land for farming, industry, and recreation.

This soil survey depicts information about the kinds and
distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data
used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as
part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.

The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with
hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an
interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot
be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried
and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested
against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform
to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation
document and amendment(s).
</attraccr></attracc><logic>
Certain node/geometry and topology GT-polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label).  Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

The boundary of this survey is matched to the adjacent SSURGO
certified surveys of Bond County, Clinton County, Marion County,
Montgomery County, Clay County, Effingham County, and Shelby County,
Illinois. Feature edges and labels are not matched to those of the adjacent
surveys.  The survey area boundaries are an exact match.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same in
terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs
in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely
identified. Each individual area is a delineation. Each map unit
consists of one or more components.

Soil scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous
(nonsoil) areas that have properties and behavior significantly
different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These
minor components may be indicated as special features. If they
have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be
precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map.

Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, SCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey
Staff, 1975, USDA, SCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
Soil Survey Staff, (current issue); National Soil Survey
Handbook, Title 430-VI, (current issue).

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service State Soil Scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.

Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In
a consociation, delineated areas are dominated by a single soil
taxon and similar soils. At least one half of the pedons in each
delineation are of the same soil component so similar to the
named soil that major interpretations are not affected
significantly. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of
other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about
15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single
component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not
exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations are named
for two or more dissimilar components with the dominant component
listed first. They occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The major
components of a complex cannot be mapped separately at a scale of
about 1:24,000. The major components of an association can be
separated at a scale of about 1:24,000. In each delineation of
either a complex or an association, each major component is normally
present, though their proportions may vary appreciably from one
delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit
that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed
15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind
of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

Undifferentiated Groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that do not always occur together in the same
delineation, but are included in the same named map unit because
use and management are the same or similar for common uses. Every
delineation has at least one of the major components and some may
have all of them. The same principles regarding proportion of
inclusions apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

Minimum documentation consists of three or more complete soil profile
descriptions for each series added to the legend. In addition,
transects were recorded as needed to support correlation decisions.
The number of steps in each transect were dependent on the size of the
particular map unit and the soil properties observed.

A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 3 acres.

The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy
Standards. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.

For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.

the shared boundaries of Montgomery County, Bond County, Clinton County,
Marion County, Clay County, and Effingham County, Illinois.  Additional
edits were made to resolve any gaps or overlaps that exceeded the 0.1

generalized with a tolerance of one meter to reduce vertex density for
the purpose of reducing the overall database size.  During this process
measures were taken to insure the line quality was not degraded.  The
data were checked with the SSURGO Evaluation AMLs provided by U.S.

The spatial data for the entire SSURGO database was recertified in October
of 2019 to reduce storage requirements and to improve map display
and geoprocessing performance.  The SSURGO data is internally managed
using 12 Regional Transactional Spatial Databases (RTSD) that are in
an ESRI File Geodatabase format.  The spatial extent of the RTSDs follow the
Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD) regional administrative boundaries.
The XY coordinate system of this RTSD is USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area
Conic USGS Version WKID: 102039 and has an XY storage precision of 0.001
meters.  The RTSDs were recreated using a reduced storage precision of 0.1
meters to reduce the physical size of the data.  The SSURGO data was also
generalized by removing excess vertices, using a tolerance of 1 meter.
The topology was validated at the CONUS level using a tolerance of 0.2

copied to a staging database, and rating values for selected
interpretations were generated. The list of selected interpretations is
stored in the database table named sainterp.

data sets for release to the Soil Data Warehouse. A system assigned
version number and date stamp were added and the data were copied to
the data warehouse. The tabular data for the map units and components
were extracted from the data warehouse and reformatted into the soil

Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.

The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.

Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
