This component is on ground moraines on till plains. The parent material consists of silty loess over silty drift. Depth to a root restrictive layer, abrupt textural change, is 15 to 19 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 6 inches during January, February, March, April, May. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ",17484894,17434911
