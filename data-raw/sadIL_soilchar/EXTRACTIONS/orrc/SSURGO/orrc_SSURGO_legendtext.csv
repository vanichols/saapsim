Classification and Correlation of the Soils of 
Pike County, Illinois

A Subset of MLRA 115C

January 2001


John C. Doll, MLRA Soil Survey Coordinator, Champaign, Illinois and Gary Struben, Soil Data Quality Specialist (SDQS) MLRA Region 11 team, Indianapolis, Indiana, prepared this correlation.   Robert Tegeler,  MLRA team leader, Springfield, Illinois contributed provided most of the information relating to the recorrelation of the soils in Pike County.  This document is prepared as part of the update of the Soil Survey of Pike County, a subset of MLRA 115C.  The correlation conference was at the Springfield MLRA office on October 16 and 17, 2000.  This correlation is based on decisions made at that conference.  Decisions were based on documentation of field investigations, transect data, field notes, pedon descriptions, laboratory data, Soil Survey of Pike County, Illinois issued 1999, and the descriptive legend in the ""Classification and Correlation of the Soils of Pike County, Illinois,"" September, 1991.  

Headnote for detailed soil survey legend:

This update of Pike County, Illinois is an update of a subset of the Soil Survey of Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) 115C.  Map units and their symbols and special and conventional symbols are consistent between subsets that are being updated.  Map unit symbols consist of a combination of numbers and letters.  The initial numbers represent the kind of soil.  A capital letter following those numbers indicates the class of slope.  A final number of 2 following the slope letter indicates that the soil is moderately eroded, and a number 3 indicates that it is severely eroded.  Absence of a number following the slope class indicates that the soil is slightly eroded or non-eroded.

Verification of exact cooperator names: For the front cover and half-title page:

United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Service
in Cooperation with the
Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station

The cooperators to be listed on the inside of the front cover are the same as those on the front cover and in addition state: ""This soil survey update is part of the technical assistance provided to the Pike County Soil and Water Conservation District.  Financial assistance was made  available by the Pike County Board and the Illinois Department of Agriculture."" 

Prior soil survey publication:  The last soil survey of Pike County was completed in 1990 and published by the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service in 1999.  It is Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station Soil Report No. 155, ""Soil Survey of Pike County, Illinois"".  Reference to the prior soil survey will be included in the literature citation of the manuscript.

This update survey replaces the prior soil survey and provides additional data, updated soil interpretations, and digital soil maps at a 1:12,000 scale on an orthophoto base.

Join statement: Pike County joins three modern soil surveys.  

Adams County - Update survey to be certified 2001
Brown County - Modern soil survey (1998)
Calhoun County - Modern soil survey (1989)


An exact join will be completed with the updated Adams County survey.  An acceptable join will be completed with the remaining adjacent counties.

Disposition of field sheets: The 135 published soil atlas sheets at a scale of 1:15,840 were rectified and ratioed to a scale of 1:12,000.  These maps serve as the base maps for the update soil survey of Pike County.  The published maps were used to recompile the soils layer onto Mylar sheets with 1:12,000 scale orthophoto quarter quads serving as a base.  Publication scale is 1:12,000 according to SSURGO standards.  Copies of a computer tape of the final  digital product will remain at the Illinois NRCS state office.  Digital spatial and attribute data will be provided to the Pike County Board as part of the cost share cooperative agreement. 

Instructions for map compilation and map finishing: Map recompilation has been completed by the Springfield MLRA team. The  soil layer is recompiled on Mylar separates at a 1:12,000 scale.  The hydrography, and connventional and special symbols layers will be recompiled onscreen using ARCINFO at a scale of 1:12,000.  The soils layer will be delivered to the Digitizing Center for scanning and digital processing.  The hydrography layer and the conventional and special symbols layer will be delivered to the Illinois NRCS state office. 

Symbols for map finishing are those approved for SSURGO standards and as shown in this document.  The Springfield MLRA team and the Illinois NRCS state office GIS staff will complete a final check of the digital materials before delivering the product to the Digitizing Center for SSURGO certification.

Conventional and special symbols legend:  Only those symbols indicated on the attached NRCS-SOILS-37A will be shown on the legend and placed on the maps.  Cultural features that appear on the 7.5 minute series topographic quadrangle will appear on the published maps.  During compilation, only those cultural features that do not appear on the 7.5 minute series topographic quadrangle have been compiled as a separate layer using ARCINFO




Definitions and Guidelines for Use of Conventional and Special Symbols

Hydrographic Features
Unclassified streamStreams which may or may not flow water throughout year.  They are less than 100 feet in width on the landscape or less than 0.10 inch on the atlas sheet.

Unclassified drainage and/or irrigation ditch
Drainage endAdd to 37A

Landform Features
Depression, closed DEPA shallow, saucer-shaped area slightly lower on the landscape than the surrounding area, but without a natural outlet for surface drainage. Typically 1/4  to 3 acres.

Escarpment, bedrockESBA relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff produced by erosion or faulting breaking the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed material is hard or soft bedrock.

Escarpment, otherESOA relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff generally produced by erosion, but can be produced by faulting breaking the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed nonbedrock material is nonsoil or very shallow, poorly developed soil. 

Short steep slopeSLPNarrow soil area that has slopes that are at least 2 slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit.

Excavations
Gravel pitGPIAn open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed, and used without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel. Typically 1/4  to 2 acres.

Mine or quarryMPIAn open excavation from which soil and underlying material is removed exposing the bedrock.  Also used to denote surface openings to underground mines.  Typically 1/4 to 2 acres. 

Miscellaneous surface features

Marsh or swampMARA water saturated, very poorly drained area, intermittently or permanently water-covered. Marsh areas are dominantly covered by sedges, cattails, and rushes. Swamps are dominantly covered by trees or shrubs. Not used in map units where poorly drained or very poorly drained soils are the named components. Typically 1/2 to 3 acres.

Rock outcrop (includes sandstone and shaleROCAn exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth.  Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow over bedrock.  Typically 1/4 to 2 acres.

Sandy spotSANSurface layer with sand content greater than 75 percent in areas where the surface layer of the named soils of the surrounding map unit have less than about 25 percent sand. Typically 1/2 to 3 acres.

Severely eroded spotEROAn area where on the average 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost from accelerated erosion. Typically 1/2 to 3 acres.



Sinkhole, levees, drainage end, gravelly spot, and wet spot are marked on the 37A, but are not listed here under definitions and guidelines for special features!

Certification Statement


The MLRA Region 11 Team Leader certifies that:

a.The fieldwork activities were completed in 4th quarter FY 2000.

b. Pike County joins three modern soil surveys:

Adams County - SSURGO certified 2001
Brown County - Modern soil survey (1998)
Calhoun County - Modern soil survey (1989)

An exact join has been completed with Adams County.  The remaining counties have an acceptable join and will have an exact join when they are updated to the MLRA legend.

c.Interpretations have been coordinated and agree with adjoining survey areas.

d.The locations of all typical pedons have been checked for accuracy, and that they occur in delineations using those names.  Typical pedons are those that represent the taxonomic units in MLRA 115C.  Not all typical pedons are located in Pike County but are within other subsets of the MLRA.

e.All typical pedons are classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999.

f.The digital soil maps, once complete, will be reviewed for accuracy and consistency prior to certification.
